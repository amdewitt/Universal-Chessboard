# Universal-Chessboard
A JavaFX 8 Application that allows you to play chess variants and create your own chess variants using text files. It has been designed to support as many chess variants as possible. If it can be thought up, the Universal Chessboard can support it...within limits of course.

Version: Alpha 0.0.1

This application is still very much a work in progress, but it already has many basic features implemented. You can view the changelog in the file changelog.txt.


The project is currently being stored as an Eclipse IDE Project and as a runnable JAR file, the latter which can be run through the command prompt using the following command:

Windows:
java -jar "(path)\Universal Chessboard <version number>.jar"

Unix:
java -jar "(path)/Universal Chessboard <version number>.jar"
